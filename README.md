# Natural Language Processing at AGH UST (2021/2022)

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks with solutions to various NLP-related tasks. The original instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/apohllo/nlp).

**Note**: While the instructions are available in English, the notebooks in this repository contain answers that were written in Polish (as per the tutor's suggestion).

## Setup

To run these notebooks, it's first required to download the necessary corpus from [here](http://apohllo.pl/text/ustawy.tar.gz). Certain notebooks might require running some external services (like Elasticsearch) or downloading some additional tools or models (such as Wordnet or Word2vec). All the extra steps required for a specific notebook should be described within the notebook itself.
